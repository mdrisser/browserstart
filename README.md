# Browser Start
I got tired of browser start pages not being customizab;e enough, if at all, and just showing stuff I'm not interested in. So, I decided to create my own browser start page that I can host myself.

The page shows one, or more, RSS Feeds containting information I'm actually interested in. It uses a TOML file (working on implementation) for listing the RSS Feed(s), then fetches it/them.

This is still a work in progress and not yet ready for release.
